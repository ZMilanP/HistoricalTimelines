The idea of this project is to provide a database of historical persons and places,
however with an added twist of geographical reference.
To this end every entity, being living or non-living, that is - static or mobile,
should have coordinates that correspond to a specific location.

Every person and every building is a 3D object on the Earth surface,
therefore all that ever existed and still exists e.g. the Pyramids
takes a particular space and occupies a particular Timeline.
Buldings do not move, so their locations are fixed, but humans, vehicles and animals
present a much different challenge as their locations may cover a lot of points
throughout their lifetimes.

These information should at a further point be cross-refferenced to a geographical map
to offer paths of movement and interractions in important historical events!
The project is far from completion as this is just a conceptual imagining of such a database.
